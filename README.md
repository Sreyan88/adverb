Code for the ICCV 2023 paper: [AdVerb: Visually Guided Audio Dereverberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12370)  

The ```model``` folder contains the code for our model. You can easily import it from ```model/models/adverb.py```. Training code and checkpoints will be released in a few days!

Our code is inspired from [Visual Acoustic Matching](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visual-acoustic-matching).
